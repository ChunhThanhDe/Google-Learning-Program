## 📝 Writing Documentation in Ticketing or Bug Systems

Now that we've talked a little bit about documenting processes, let's talk about how you write documentation in ticketing or bug systems.

### 🔁 Reusing Documentation

You don't have to leave a full example of process documentation for every ticket you handle. If you encounter the same issue, just write the documentation once, then refer back to it.

### 📊 Leaving an Audit Trail

One of the more important aspects of writing documentation in a ticket or bug system is that you leave an audit trail to see what worked and what didn't.

### 📎 Examples of Documentation in Ticketing and Bug Systems

Let's take a look at some examples of awesome documentation and not-so-awesome documentation in ticketing and bug systems.

### ❌ Not-So-Awesome Documentation

This isn't helpful at all since we don't know what the issue was or what the IT support specialist did to fix it. If someone stumbled upon this ticket with the same issue, it would be pretty useless.

### ✅ Awesome Documentation

This is an example of great ticket documentation. The tech described what the issue is, what caused the issue, and the specific steps they took to resolve it.
