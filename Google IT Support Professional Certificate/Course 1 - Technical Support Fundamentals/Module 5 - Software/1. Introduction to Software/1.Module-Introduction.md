# Introduction to Computer Software

## About Me
👋 Hi! My name is Phelan Vendeville, and I'm a Systems Engineer in the Site Reliability Organization at Google. I'm thrilled to be your instructor for the upcoming lessons. Before we jump in, let me tell you a little bit about myself. My passion for technology began in high school, which was located in a geographically isolated part of California. This isolation meant that technology and the Internet played an important role in bringing the outside world to students and connecting them with ideas and opportunities through virtual field trips and remote learning. For example, I remember preparing for the SATs through digital classroom sessions, which would have been impossible to attend in person. After high school, I enlisted in the US Navy as an Information Systems Technician, responsible for maintaining computer and network systems. I continued to witness the ways technology brings people together, whether that meant coordinating ship movements during training exercises or connecting loved ones on long deployments via video chat.

## The Power of Technology
💡 Lots of people use technology in various ways every day, but relatively few truly understand how it works. A career in IT can be challenging, as I can personally attest. I still remember the horror I felt after accidentally blowing up the power supply of a master chief's computer by using the wrong voltage switch. However, a career in IT can also be incredibly rewarding, such as when you can recover irreplaceable family photos from a failing hard drive. As an IT support specialist, you'll be in a position to not only understand how a given piece of technology functions but also know how to fix it when it breaks. This means you'll have a direct impact on the flow of information between people, which is pretty cool.

## Introduction to Software
🖥️ I'm excited to teach you about the third layer of computer architecture, known as software. Software is how we, as users, directly interact with our computers. The operating system we interact with is just software. The music programs, word processors, and more that we use every day are also software. But what exactly is software? If hardware represents the physical components that you can pick up and hold, software refers to the intangible instructions that tell the hardware what to do.

## What's Next?
🔍 In the next lesson, we'll dive deeper into what software is, how we install it, and how it works.

Stay tuned for an exciting journey into the world of computer software! If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out. 😊
